## Submission for allevents Assignment 

### Features Implemented
- Splash Screen
- Facebook login 
- Home Page
- Bottom Sheet
- Event List
- Event Grid
- Button to Toggle between List/Grid
- Webview
- Used APIs Wherever possible (Avoided hardcoding information obtainable from APIs)

### Features Not Implemented with Reasons
- Logout: Implemented the logout function but button was aesthetically unpleasing so avoided.
- Sub categories: Because they were not getting received from given api call.
- State Managers: Would have definitely implemented Bloc for production or at least Provider, but opted for basic set state due to the assignment's simplicity.
- Sorting: Considered it, but deemed it lengthy for the assignment's purpose.
- Searching: Deemed excessive for the assignment's scope.
